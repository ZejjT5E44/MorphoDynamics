# Morphodynamics <img src="/images/logo.png" alt="alt text" width="50">

This software can be used to analyze the dynamics of single-cells imaged by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. The dynamics of morphology and fluorescence intensity distribution can be jointly analyzed through the segmentation and splitting of cells into a set of smaller regions (windows) that can be represented as two-dimensional grids to facilitate interpretation of events.

This software has been developed at Bern University by CÃ©dric Vonesch (Science IT Support and Pertz lab) and Guillaume Witz (Microscopy Imaging Center and Science IT Support) with the collaboration of Jakobus van Unen (Pertz lab).

**For a complete documentation see the [Morphodynamics website](https://guiwitz.github.io/MorphoDynamics/mydocs/Introduction.html)**.

## Install the package

This software can be installed via pip using the following command:

```
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/guiwitz/morphodynamics.git@master#egg=morphodynamics
```

## Notebooks

While the software can be used via its API, notebooks implementing a user interface are also provided. You can download two notebooks for interactive analysis here:
- [Morpho_segmentation.ipynb](https://guiwitz.github.io/MorphoDynamics/Morpho_segmentation.ipynb)] where you can run cell segmentation and splitting interactively
- [InterfaceFiguresTabs.ipynb](https://guiwitz.github.io/MorphoDynamics/InterfaceFiguresTabs.ipynb)] where you can explore the data analysis output interactively

## Environment

To ensure that you have all recommended packages to perform interactive work, we recommend to create en environment with conda. If you don't have conda installed yet, follow [these instructions](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to install a minimal version called miniconda.

To create the appropriate environment that will for example also contain the optional dependency ```cellpose``` for cell segmentation, save the following [environment.yml](https://guiwitz.github.io/MorphoDynamics/environment.yml) file to your computer (use ```Save as``` in your browser) and execute the following command from where you downloaded it:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Then activate the environment:

```
conda activate morphodynamics
```

The Morphodynamics package is automatically installed in that environment.


## Updates

To update your local installation with the latest version available on GitHub, activate the environment and install the package directly from GitHub:

```
conda activate morphodynamics 
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/guiwitz/MorphoDynamics.git@master#egg=morphodynamics
```

Note: close all notebooks (click on File | Close and Halt) prior to the update and reopen them afterwards.

## Usage

Whenever you want to use Jupyter and the Morphodynamics package, open a terminal, activate the environment 

```
conda activate morphodynamics
```

and start a Jupyter session:

```
jupyter notebook
```

## Development

Versioning is done automatically via ```setuptools_scm```. To increment a version, create a new tag and push it to GitHub:

```
git tag -m "git versioning" -a X.Y.Z
git push origin X.Y.Z
```
